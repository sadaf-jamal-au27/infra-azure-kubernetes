## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- Path: .github/workflows/terraform.yml
- Triggers: Push to main, pull requests
- Stages: Plan → Security Scan → Apply → Compliance Check
- Security: OIDC authentication, no stored secrets

### Security Scanning

- Checkov: Infrastructure security scanning
- TFSec: Terraform-specific security analysis
- Automated: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Sizing

- AKS: Standard_B2s nodes for development
- SQL Database: S0 tier (suitable for development/testing)
- Storage: Minimal redundancy for cost efficiency
- Key Vault: Premium for HSM requirements

### Auto-scaling

- AKS: Cluster autoscaler enabled (1-3 nodes)
- SQL: Auto-pause for development workloads
- Storage: Pay-as-you-go model

## Next Steps

### Application Deployment
