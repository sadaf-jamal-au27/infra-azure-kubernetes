7. **CKV2_AZURE_33**: Storage account private endpoints implemented (2 instances)
8. **CKV2_AZURE_45**: SQL Server private endpoint implemented

## ❌ Remaining Issues (Only 2 Advanced Security Controls)

### CKV_AZURE_33: Storage Queue Service Logging (2 instances)
**Status**: Known Terraform Provider Limitation
**Impact**: Low (Logging feature only)
**Description**: Azure Storage Analytics for queue service not supported by Terraform azurerm provider
**Current Implementation**: 
- ✅ Diagnostic settings added for partial compliance
- ✅ Azure CLI commands prepared for post-deployment
**Mitigation**: Post-deployment Azure CLI configuration available

#### Post-Deployment Solution:
```bash
# Enable queue logging for main storage account
az storage logging update \
  --account-name <storage-account-name> \
  --auth-mode login \
  --services q \
  --log rwd \
  --retention 10

# Enable queue logging for SQL audit storage account  
az storage logging update \
  --account-name <audit-storage-account-name> \
  --auth-mode login \
  --services q \
  --log rwd \
  --retention 10
```
